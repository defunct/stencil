I'm wondering if Markdown is going to be better about line breaks, or if I'm
going to have the same issues I've had with Textile.

 * Wondering if line breaks work with lists.
 * I saw Markdown doing the smart thing with comments in a git comment that got
   shuffled to Lighthouse.
 * Will that work here? Markdown is inspired by email.

This is my markdown entry. Let's see where it gets me.

Oh, happy day! I'll simply do my blogging in ViM using Markdown. With some
search and replace, I can make use of all of curlybraces.org content and move it
my GitHub pages. I'll be able to read my own posts in ViM.
